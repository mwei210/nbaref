NBAREF is a full-stack web application that utilizes the NBA's API. Inspired by [Basketball Reference](https://www.basketball-reference.com/), it allows users to search for a specific player and view information related to that player.

## Planned features
NBAREF includes three main features:

### Player search

Users can type in the name of a player they want to look up into the search bar and be shown a list of hits that match the criteria.

### Player profile

Each player has their own stats page that tabulates their stats into a chart.

### Teams

Players belong to a team, which are their own entities that can be searched for and display their own stats.

### Seasons

Player and team stats are collected and categorized into discrete seasons. Player and team profiles will display all seasons that exist.

### Data page links

Team and player profiles, whenever they mention player-seasons or team-seasons will offer links to those pages.

### User and team index

Users can click into viewing a master list of players and teams sorted in alphabetical order.

## Stretch goals

### Search auto-complete

Upon entering letters into the search field, a dropdown of potential matches will appear automatically.

### User login & authentication

Users can create accounts, log in to them, and favorite specific teams and players.

### Advanced search

Users can provide specific ranges for stats to see which teams or players fall within the criteria entered.
